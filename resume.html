<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Pokemon Red with Reinforcement Learning</h3>
This project addresses reinforcement learning by modifying a pre-existing Pokemon Red agent. This agent uses Stable Baselines Q-Learning algorithm with TensorBoard. The goal of this agent is to defeat the Pewter City and Cerulean City gym leaders aquiring their badges. Using the PyBoy emulator, the agent is positively rewarded to capture and record all new screens visited, incentivising the agent to explore the map.
